I cook the chicken first in a hot oven as it can go a bit rubbery and I don’t add the sultanas. I only add 700ml of liquid and I put foil over the pan before the lid to give a really good fit. I then cook for 9 minutes on very low heat and then leave off the heat with the lid on for 10 mins. </p></section></div>
	
		<div id="container" class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12"><section class="section"><h2 class="beef">Beef</h2><p>I've made this a few times now. At first I thought it was OK but the last time not so much, so I decided to tinker with it. I found the original to be too tomatoey, too runny, and lacking in flavour a bit.</p></section></div>
	
		<div id="container" class="col-lg-4 col-md-12 col-sm-12"><section class="section"><h2 class="sushi">Sushi</h2><p>This huge variety of small, elegant Japanese foods is based on a special variety of short-grain rice that is lightly vinegared and then served with a selection of raw or cooked fish and vegetables. These are commonly rolled together in a wrap of nori seaweed and then sliced to make pieces of beautiful appearance.</p></section></div>
